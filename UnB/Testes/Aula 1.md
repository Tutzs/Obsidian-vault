### The art of software testing

Capítulo 1 

Since the book came out software testing become more difficult and easier than ever.

Software testing is more difficult because of the vast array of programming languages, operating systems, and hardware platforms.

Today’s concept of ‘‘computer’’ is much broader and more difficult to define.

To our way of thinking, a well-constructed and executed software test is successful when it finds errors that can be fixed. That same test is also successful when it eventually establishes that there are no more errors to be found.

The only unsuccessful test is one that does not properly examine the software; and, in the majority of cases, a test that found no errors likely would be considered unsuccessful, since the concept of a program without errors is basically unrealistic

That is, an error is clearly present if a program does not do what it is supposed to do; but errors are also present if a program does what it is not supposed to do

Program testing is more properly viewed as the destructive process of trying to find the errors in a program (whose presence is assumed). A successful test case is one that furthers progress in this direction by causing the program to fail.
